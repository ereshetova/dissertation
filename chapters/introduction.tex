Nowadays platform security is an essential component for many devices around us and has many aspects: access control, integrity protection, platform hardening, etc.
This thesis takes a look on two areas: access control/process isolation and OS kernel hardening. 
I show that despite the long history of this topic in both research and industry, many problems still exists in modern systems, as well as present solutions for some of them. 

\section{Motivation}

Here motivate that access control/process isolation, as well as OS kernel hardening are one of the biggest practical challenges for today platform security architectures despite millions of past works both in academia and industry. 

Outline the common problems in process isolation and access control policies: finding correct level of isolation, ac granularity, and flexibility to satisfy different use cases, managing complexity of constantly changing OSes (policy has to change together), development aspects (developers do not understand security, but understand (sometimes) what their processes/apps do), etc. 

Outline the common problems in OS kernel hardening: long lifecycle of bugs (even in upstream), lack of fix propagation to all devices, lack of knowledge, need to eliminate bug classes or exploitation methods, etc.   

\section{Outline}

This section gives an outline of the thesis divided into two main chapters: one for process isolation and access control, another one for OS kernel hardening. Last section is a discussion chapter. First section contains necessary background.
